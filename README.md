# Split-string
## Aim
To split a given string from a given character.
## Theory
This is a very simple program where we have used a for loop nested with an if-else statement to break the string from a given character. We have also used the gets() and puts() function instead of printf and scanf. 
## Algorithm
Step 1:Start. 
Step 2:Initialize a string and a character and take inputs for both from the user. 
Step 3:Using for loop, check if the character is a null value. If not, enter loop. 
Step 4:Check if the entered character and the current character of the string are the same. If yes, we break the string from there and go to a new line. If they are not equal, we just print the character. 
Step 5:End. 
## Conclusion
In this practical, we used our basic knowledge of loops and executed a program for breaking a string from any given character in the string.
